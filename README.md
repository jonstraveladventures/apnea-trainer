## üìñ Comprehensive Usage Guide

### Getting Started

#### 1. **Profile Setup**
- When you first open the app, you'll be prompted to create a profile
- Enter your name and current max breath-hold time
- You can create multiple profiles for different users or training phases

#### 2. **Understanding the Main Dashboard**
- The main page shows your dynamic 7-day training plan
- Each day displays the scheduled session type with completion status
- Click "View Details" to see the complete session breakdown
- Click on any day to start that session

#### 3. **Session Types Explained**

##### CO‚ÇÇ Tolerance Training
- **Purpose**: Build tolerance to CO‚ÇÇ buildup, which is the primary limiting factor in breath-holds
- **Structure**: Progressive breath-hold tables with decreasing rest periods
- **Example**: 5 holds starting at 45 seconds, increasing by 15 seconds each, with rest periods decreasing from 60 to 30 seconds
- **Benefits**: Extends your breath-hold time by training your body to tolerate higher CO‚ÇÇ levels

##### O‚ÇÇ Tolerance Training
- **Purpose**: Improve oxygen utilization and efficiency
- **Structure**: Extended breath-holds with long rest periods (2:1 rest ratio)
- **Example**: 4 holds at 60% of max hold time with 2-minute rest periods
- **Benefits**: Teaches your body to use oxygen more efficiently

##### Breath Control
- **Purpose**: Master various breathing techniques for better breath-hold preparation
- **Structure**: Combination of diaphragmatic, alternate nostril, and box breathing
- **Components**: 
  - 10 minutes diaphragmatic breathing
  - 5 minutes alternate nostril breathing
  - 8 cycles of box breathing (4-4-4-4 pattern)
- **Benefits**: Improves breathing efficiency and mental focus

##### Mental + Technique
- **Purpose**: Develop mental preparation and visualization skills
- **Structure**: Visualization, mindfulness, and progressive relaxation
- **Components**:
  - 15 minutes guided visualization
  - 10 minutes mindfulness practice
  - 10 minutes progressive muscle relaxation
  - 2 mindful breath-holds at 60% of max
- **Benefits**: Mental preparation is crucial for successful breath-holds

##### Max Breath-Hold
- **Purpose**: Progressive training to increase your maximum breath-hold time
- **Structure**: 
  - Stretch confirmation before starting
  - 2-minute tidal breathing phase
  - Progressive holds at 25%, 35%, 50%, 65%, 100%, 100% of max
  - CO‚ÇÇ tolerance training between max holds
- **Benefits**: Systematic approach to increasing your maximum breath-hold time

### Advanced Features

- **Custom Sessions**: Your custom sessions appear in the dropdown with a üéØ icon
- **Dynamic Updates**: Session phases automatically update when you change the session type
- **Real-time Preview**: See the session structure before starting

#### Custom Session Creation
- **Template-Based**: Start with proven training templates and customize
- **Phase Types**: Choose from hold, breathing, mental, or custom phases
- **Smart Progressive Logic**: 
  - Progressive phases only appear when there are previous phases of the same type
  - Clear labeling: "Progressive (add/subtract from previous hold phase)"
  - Automatic reset to "Fixed Duration" when no previous phases exist
- **Flexible Parameters**: Adjust duration, intensity, and structure to match your needs

#### Profile Management
- **Multiple Profiles**: Create separate profiles for different users or training phases
- **Profile-Specific Data**: Each profile maintains its own:
  - Training history and completion status
  - Custom sessions
  - Max hold time
  - Weekly schedule preferences
- **Easy Switching**: Quick dropdown menu to switch between profiles

#### Data Management
- **Export Training Data**: Backup your training history and custom sessions
- **Import Data**: Restore from backup or transfer between devices
- **Automatic Saving**: All data is automatically saved locally

### Training Best Practices

#### Safety First
- **Never train alone**: Always have a buddy or be in a safe environment
- **Listen to your body**: Stop if you feel unsafe or experience warning signs
- **Start conservatively**: Begin with shorter holds and gradually increase
- **Rest adequately**: Don't rush between sessions

#### Training Progression
- **Consistency**: Train regularly, ideally 3-5 times per week
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase intensity over time
- **Recovery**: Include rest days and recovery sessions
- **Variety**: Mix different session types for balanced development

#### Mental Preparation
- **Visualization**: Practice mental imagery of successful breath-holds
- **Relaxation**: Learn to stay calm and relaxed during holds
- **Focus**: Develop concentration skills for better performance
- **Mindfulness**: Practice being present and aware during training
